IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
It serves two primary purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing. There are two main types of IP addresses: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).
IPv4 addresses are typically written in the format of four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 addresses are written in a more complex hexadecimal
format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Port:
A port is a logical endpoint for communication in a computer network. It's used to identify a specific process or service to which data packets should be delivered. Ports are essential for 
enabling multiple applications to run simultaneously on a single device, each with its own communication channels. Ports are represented by numbers, and they are divided into
two ranges: well-known ports (0-1023) for standardized services like HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443), and dynamic or private ports (1024-65535) for temporary or user-specific purposes.

HTTP Methods:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. HTTP methods, also known as HTTP verbs, specify the desired action to be performed on a resource. 
Some common HTTP methods include:

GET: Retrieve data from the server.
POST: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
PUT: Send data to the server to update or replace an existing resource.
DELETE: Request the removal of a resource from the server.
PATCH: Apply partial modifications to a resource.
HEAD: Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers of a resource without the actual data.
OPTIONS: Retrieve the communication options for the target resource.
MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) or network adapter of a network device, such as a computer, smartphone, or router. It operates at the data link layer
of the OSI model and is used for addressing and delivering data packets within a local network (Ethernet or Wi-Fi). A MAC address consists of six pairs of hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F), separated 
by colons or hyphens (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
